 ## File Structure
 The project is in early development phase, in order to run it properly you need to export an .obj file from Cinema4D.<br><br>
 The Program will check whether the first line of the .obj contains the following string:
 ```
	# WaveFront *.obj file (generated by CINEMA 4D)
 ```
 (All files not containing this won't be accepted!)<br><br>
 
 Before the vectors/fields are defined, are named group is required! If the name is not set before the first vector/field, the program stops. So make sure you defined a group as followed:
 ```
	g your_name_here
	
	Example:
	g building
 ```
 
 The syntax of a vector:
 ```
	v <x> <y> <z>
	
	Example:
	v 1.423423 3.423523 -0.312687
 ```
 
  The syntax of a field:
 ```
	f <index1> <index2> <index3> (<index4>) //index 4 is optional
	
	Example:
	f 1 2 3
	f 6 8 1 5
 ```
 (other field declarations aren't accepted for current version)
